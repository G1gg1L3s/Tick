# Tick

This is my project of toy compiler. Because of the lack of better name I'm going to call it Tick.
The main idea is to create a basic compiler for C-like lang with rust-like syntax.
Currently work is in progress, but if you see it is not, feel free to contact me and recall that I promised to finish this project.

  - [x] lexing
  - [x] parsing expression
  - [x] parsing items
  - [ ] better error recovery
  - [ ] name resolution
  - [ ] type checking
  - [ ] modules
